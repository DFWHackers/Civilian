# What to Do If You Are Pulled Over?
This repo is built to make a MVP for a HACKDFW challenge

## Tyler Technologies challenge statement
The American Judicial System strives to be one of the most fair and expedient in the world. While the option of virtual court has improved one of the major hurdles of simply accessing a courtroom, no system is perfect. Factors like economic disparity, equality of representation, and media bias can influence the process and outcomes. Build an app, website, plug-in, or other tool that could help improve the fairness of the American Judicial System.
