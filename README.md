# CIVILIAN
This app supports you during a traffic stop!

## Tyler Technologies challenge statement
The American Judicial System strives to be one of the most fair and expedient in the world. While the option of virtual court has improved one of the major hurdles of simply accessing a courtroom, no system is perfect. Factors like economic disparity, equality of representation, and media bias can influence the process and outcomes. Build an app, website, plug-in, or other tool that could help improve the fairness of the American Judicial System.

## The philsophy of this app
People with lower levels of education tend not to know their rights protected by the Judicial system. 
We developed this web app to educate civilians on their rights immediately when facing the police.
